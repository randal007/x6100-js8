 *  Xiegu X6100 LVGL GUI - the drive level of a JS8 transmission
 *
 *  tx_player.c plays a JS8 frame in blocks of 2048 samples (about 43 ms at
 *  48 kHz) and reads the radio's ALC and power after each. The old loop
 *  turned the gain after every block from that one reading: up to +0.6 dB
 *  whenever the power read short, down when the ALC rose. The radio reads
 *  power in 0.1 W steps, so at 0.3 W a true 0.28 W reads 0.2 W "short",
 *  and the drive swung by several dB a second (VE7NHW, 2026-10-04: an
 *  XPA125B behind it went 18-35 W and back every two seconds).
 *
 *  Now, with readings averaged over half a second: while the ALC reads
 *  zero the drive ramps up, one way only (1 dB a second while the power is
 *  under half the setting, then 0.5 dB a second), and stops for the rest
 *  of the transmission once the ALC shows (it then holds the power at the
 *  setting, whatever the 0.1 W reading says) or the power reads the
 *  setting. Overdrive (ALC over 0.5) brings it down a little. The level
 *  found is kept (tx_player.c), so the next transmission starts there and
 *  stays steady. Pure arithmetic: tests/test_js8.cpp runs it against a
 *  model radio.
