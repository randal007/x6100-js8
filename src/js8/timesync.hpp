 *
 *  Desktop JS8Call-improved's Automatic Time Drift (44fa092,
 *  JS8_Mainwindow/processDecodeEvent.cpp, JS8_UI/WideGraph.cpp), which the
 *  JS8Call-improved Android app uses for its "Auto time sync" too: every
 *  decoded Normal or Slow frame suggests the drift that would put it on
 *  time, and at the end of each decode pass they're folded into a
 *  cumulative moving average of up to 60 frames, which becomes the drift.
 *  One heartbeat is enough to start.
 *
 *  And a search for when the clock is too far off for anything to decode
 *  (the Normal decoder looks only about 2.5 s either side of the slot):
 *  desktop decodes Normal every second while its automatic drift starts;
 *  here the latest 15 s of audio is decoded every 4 s, which finds a
 *  signal wherever it falls in the 15 s cycle at about a quarter of the
 *  cost. The first decode gives the drift.
